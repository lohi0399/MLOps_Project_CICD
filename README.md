# MLOps_Project_CICD

Step 1:

1. Set up the github repository
 (a) New environment (venv) -- use python -m venv .venv in the cmd and activate it using .\.venv\Scripts\activate (in windows) -- This helps us in freezing all the libraries which I will be using for this particular project
 --Add a gitingore file manually or from the repo itself in the browser
 (b) Setup.py -- This is important if you want to make you code into a package which can be install using pip, and can be hosted on python pypy
 (c) requirements.txt
